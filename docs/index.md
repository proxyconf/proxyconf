# ProxyConf

![Image title](./assets/logow.png){ align=center } 

**ProxyConf** is a control plane for [Envoyproxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) that simplifies and secures API management in enterprise environments. It leverages the OpenAPI specification to streamline the configuration of Envoyproxy, providing a powerful yet user-friendly platform for managing, and securing API traffic at scale.


!!! Warning
    
    ProxyConf is **currently in development** and under active construction ‚ö†Ô∏è. While it may already be **usable for some cases**, there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll encounter **bugs or incomplete features**.
    
    However, your feedback is incredibly valuable to us! üöÄ If you're feeling adventurous, we‚Äôd love for you to try it out and let us know what works, what doesn‚Äôt, and where we can improve. Together, we can make ProxyConf even better!


## Key Features

- **Envoyproxy Integration**
    - High-performance routing, load balancing, and traffic management.
    - Built-in observability with metrics, logging, and tracing.
    - Security features like JWT authentication, TLS termination, and rate limiting.

    - **SOAP/WSDL Support:**  Support for SOAP-based APIs and WSDL specifications, enabling seamless integration with legacy systems.

## Demo Setup

To quickly explore the capabilities of **ProxyConf**, we provide a demo environment that can be easily launched using Docker Compose. The demo setup, located inside the `demo` folder, includes all the necessary components to run a local instance of Envoyproxy with ProxyConf, configured to proxy traffic to a local instance of the **Swagger Petstore** API.

### Steps to Run the Demo

1. **Start the Demo Environment**  
   Bring up the environment with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   cd demo

   docker-compose up --pull always
   ```

2. **Create OAuth Client Configuration**  
   Use the following command to create an OAuth client configuration, which is required to retrieve an access token for managing the cluster:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://localhost:4000/api/create-config/demo \
        --cacert ../control_plane/test/support/certs/snakeoil-ca.crt
   ```

   Example response:
   ```json
   {
       "client_id": "demo",
       "client_secret": "1Q1ea-txiDn8AQ39Vs69CLn3k9yFBy-eQOcTyw6pE5gQmZvr5wOMD0RpkZCKUunk"
   }
   ```

3. **Retrieve OAuth Access Token**  
   Use the generated OAuth client configuration to retrieve an access token:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://localhost:4000/api/access-token?client_id=demo&client_secret=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>&grant_type=client_credentials" \
        --cacert ../control_plane/test/support/certs/snakeoil-ca.crt
   ```

   Example response:
   ```json
   {
       "access_token": "ACCESS-TOKEN",
       "created_at": "2024-12-10T21:08:33",
       "expires_in": 7200,
       "refresh_token": null,
       "scope": "cluster-admin",
       "token_type": "bearer"
   }
   ```

4. **Upload the Petstore Specification**  
   Upload the OpenAPI specification of the Swagger Petstore to ProxyConf:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://localhost:4000/api/spec/petstore \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS-TOKEN>" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" \
        --data-binary "@demo/proxyconf/oas3specs/petstore.yaml" \
        --cacert ../control_plane/test/support/certs/snakeoil-ca.crt
   ```

   Response:
   ```text
   OK
   ```

5. **Explore the Setup**  
   The demo environment configures **ProxyConf** to manage and secure the **Swagger Petstore** API. The Petstore API is reachable at `https://localhost:8080/petstore`.

   You can test the setup with an example API key configured in the `petstore.yaml` OpenAPI specification:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://localhost:8080/petstore/pet/findByStatus?status=pending" \
        -H "my-api-key: supersecret" \
        --cacert ../control_plane/test/support/certs/snakeoil-ca.crt
   ```

   Example response:
   ```json
   [
       {
           "id": 3,
           "category": { "id": 2, "name": "Cats" },
           "name": "Cat 3",
           "photoUrls": ["url1", "url2"],
           "tags": [
               { "id": 1, "name": "tag3" },
               { "id": 2, "name": "tag4" }
           ],
           "status": "pending"
       },
       {
           "id": 6,
           "category": { "id": 1, "name": "Dogs" },
           "name": "Dog 3",
           "photoUrls": ["url1", "url2"],
           "tags": [
               { "id": 1, "name": "tag3" },
               { "id": 2, "name": "tag4" }
           ],
           "status": "pending"
       }
   ]
   ```

### Key Components

- **Envoyproxy**: Handles traffic routing and load balancing.
- **ProxyConf**: Configures Envoyproxy using OpenAPI specs, providing centralized policy management and enhanced security features.
- **Swagger Petstore**: A demo API specified in `demo/proxyconf/oas3specs/petstore.yaml` that Envoy proxies traffic to, allowing you to experiment with API management features such as routing, TLS termination, and request validation.
- **Postgres Database**: The persistence layer for ProxyConf.

This demo provides a hands-on way to see how **ProxyConf** simplifies the configuration and management of Envoyproxy.
