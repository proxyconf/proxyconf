  summary: Misc
  description: |
    Downstream TLS is implicitely configured by providing a `https` URL in the `x-proxyconf.url` configuration. The server certificate used for the listener is selected by matching the `x-proxyconf.url` hostname with the TLS Common Name (CN) or TLS Subject Alternative Names (SAN) found in the TLS certificates available in [PROXYCONF_SERVER_DOWNSTREAM_TLS_PATH](../config/environment.md/#proxyconf_server_downstream_tls_path).
