**ProxyConf** is a control plane for [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) that simplifies and secures API management in enterprise environments. It leverages the OpenAPI specification to streamline the configuration of Envoy, providing a powerful yet user-friendly platform for managing, and securing API traffic at scale.

> [!WARNING]
> ProxyConf is **currently in development** and under active construction ‚ö†Ô∏è. While it may already be **usable for some cases**, there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll encounter **bugs or incomplete features**.
>
> However, your feedback is incredibly valuable to us! üöÄ If you're feeling adventurous, we‚Äôd love for you to try it out and let us know what works, what doesn‚Äôt, and where we can improve. Together, we can make ProxyConf even better!

## üîß Demo Setup

To quickly explore the capabilities of **ProxyConf**, we provide a demo environment that can be easily launched using Docker Compose. The demo setup, located inside the `demo` folder, includes all the necessary components to run a local instance of Envoy with ProxyConf, configured to proxy traffic to a local instance of the **Swagger Petstore** API.

### Steps to Run the Demo:
1. **Generate TLS Certificates**: Before starting the demo, you need to generate the required TLS certificates by running the `setup-certificates.sh` script located in the `demo` folder:
   ```bash
   ./setup-certificates.sh
   ```
2. **Start the Demo Environment**: Once the certificates are generated, you can bring up the environment with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --pull always
   ```
3. **Explore the Setup**: The demo environment sets up **ProxyConf** to manage and secure Envoy, which acts as a gateway proxying traffic to a local instance of the **Swagger Petstore**. The Swagger Petstore is a sample API, allowing you to test ProxyConf‚Äôs routing, security, and traffic management features in a real-world scenario. E.g.:
  ```bash
  curl -vv https://localhost:8080/petstore/pet/findByStatus --cacert demo/proxyconf/ca.crt -H "my-api-key: supersecret"
  ``` 

### Key Components:
- **Envoy Proxy**: Handles traffic routing and load balancing.
- **ProxyConf**: Configures Envoy using OpenAPI specs, providing centralized policy management and enhanced security features.
- **Swagger Petstore**: A demo API specified in `demo/proxyconf/oas3specs/petstore.yaml` that Envoy proxies traffic to, allowing you to experiment with API management features such as routing, TLS termination, and request validation.

This demo provides a hands-on way to see how **ProxyConf** simplifies the configuration and management of Envoy.
