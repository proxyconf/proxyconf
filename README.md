**ProxyConf** is a control plane for [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) that simplifies and secures API management in enterprise environments. It leverages the OpenAPI specification to streamline the configuration of Envoy, providing a powerful yet user-friendly platform for managing, and securing API traffic at scale.

## üîß Demo Setup

To quickly explore the capabilities of **ProxyConf**, we provide a demo environment that can be easily launched using Docker Compose. The demo setup, located inside the `demo` folder, includes all the necessary components to run a local instance of Envoyproxy with ProxyConf, configured to proxy traffic to a local instance of the **Swagger Petstore** API.

### Quick Start

1. **Start the Demo Environment**  
   Bring up the environment with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   cd demo

   docker-compose up --pull always
   ```

2. **Follow the Full Demo Instructions**  
   For detailed steps, including creating OAuth clients, retrieving access tokens, and testing the setup, refer to the [get started guide](docs/get_started/index.md).

### Key Components

- **Envoyproxy**: Handles traffic routing and load balancing.
- **ProxyConf**: Configures Envoyproxy using OpenAPI specs, providing centralized policy management and enhanced security features.
- **Swagger Petstore**: A demo API specified in `demo/proxyconf/oas3specs/petstore.yaml` that Envoy proxies traffic to, allowing you to experiment with API management features such as routing, TLS termination, and request validation.
- **Postgres Database**: The persistence layer for ProxyConf.

This demo provides a hands-on way to see how **ProxyConf** simplifies the configuration and management of Envoyproxy.
